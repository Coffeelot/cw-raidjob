# PVE Raid Job 🔫


We loved the idea of PVE combat jobs and the [PS-Methjob](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-methrun) was such a great template. We decided to generalize it so more jobs with similar structure could be created without any coding. We kept the original job in the config as an example. 

The job is simple:
You find the mission giver NPC (at the time of day when you are willing to give you the mission). Pay the fee. You'll get an email with info and a GPS marker. Go there, shoot some dudes up and steal the loot. The first security layer is a puzzle, the second is timed. Make sure you DO NOT bring this close to the boss while it's ticking. After the mission-specific timer is over the case will open and you will recieve the item the boss wants. You can turn it in at any time and get the reward.

# Tokens 🔑

At the top of the Config you will find `Config.UseTokens = false`. Change `false` to `true` if you want to use [cw-tokens](https://github.com/Coffeelot/cw-tokens).
# Job Creation 🔧
All you need to do to add more jobs is to add new Job objects (with all the required things) in the config.lua file. We included several examples showcasing a variety of functionality. Don't forget to add the job object into the *Config.Jobs* object at the bottom of the file! 
## Job object (see CokeJob for example)
**JobName**: Variable identifier for the job. Needs to be unique\
**Boss**: Object that contains info about the quest giving NPC\
**Guards**: Object that contains info about the guards\
**Vehicles**: Objetct that contain info on vehicles placed around the area\
**Items**: Object that contains info on the objects and items used in the job\
**MinimumPolice**: Integer of how many police are needed to start the job\
**RunCost**: Integer of how much the job costs to take\
**Payout**: Integer of how much the job pays out\
**SpecialRewards**: (optional) Object of special rewards

## Boss object (see CokeBoss for example)
**coords**: Vector4 that sets location of boss\
**model**: Ped model of boss. See link at bottom for list\
**animation**: (optional) Animation for the boss. See link at bottom for list\
**missionTitle**: String that shows up in game\
**available = {from, to}**: (optional) Objetct that sets the time the job is available\

## Item object (see CokeItems for example)
**FetchItemLocation**: Vector4 that sets location of fetch object\
**FetchItemTime**: Time it takes for the object to "open" after it has been taken (milliseconds)\
**FetchItem**: Name of the object you want to use (that shows up in inventory)\  
**FetchItemProp**: (optional) Name of the in game prop that shows up\
**FetchItemContents**: Name of the object you want to get (that shows up in inventory). This is the item that is returned to the boss\
**FetchItemContentsAmount**: Integer of how many you get.\
**FetchItemMinigame = { Type, Variables = {var1, var2...} }**: (optional) Sets the minigame or the difficulty. Defaults to a thermite game. The *Type* is the name of the minigame. The *Variables* follow the same order as shown on the PS-UI github page (link at bottom) but here is the quick version:

```
Circle: NumberOfCircles, MS
Maze: Hack Time Limit (this one seems to be broken, but might get fixed in future PS-UI updates)
VarHack: Number of Blocks, Time (seconds)
Thermite: Time, Gridsize (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), IncorrectBlocks
Scrambler: Type (alphabet, numeric, alphanumeric, greek, braille, runes), Time (Seconds), Mirrored (0: Normal, 1: Normal + Mirrored 2: Mirrored only )
```
